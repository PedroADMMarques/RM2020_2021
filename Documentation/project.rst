Project Summary
===============

Goals Achieved
--------------

* Developed an algorithm to compute the heat and mass transfer coefficients from time-resolved temperature and pressure data in non-isothermal sloshing conditions (for a closed and adiabatic reservoir).
* Learned how to create documentation for Python code with the Sphinx tool.
* Learned how to use git and uploaded the project files alongside their documentation

Lessons Learned
---------------

* Sphinx is a very friendly tool to create documentation for Python codes
* Classes are very useful and make my life easier
